# A read/write lock will allow multiple readers at a time,
# But only one writer
# No readers can read the resource when the resource is being written, and
# No writers can write the resource when it is being read.
# Interface:
# RWLock:
#     acquireReadLock() - blocks
#     releaseReadLock()
#     acquireWriteLock() - blocks
#     releaseWriteLock()
# 
# In order to implement this feature, weâ€™ll need the lock primitive.

#ideas:
# 1. locks can copy resource to ensure that they return the correct version. 
# 2. lock removes resource from source collection and adds it back once released
# 3. key/value store to keep track of which resources are locked - lock api can do a 'permissions' check

#Just one integer

# acquire lock -> block resource -> confirmation -> perform operation -> confirmation -> release resource
